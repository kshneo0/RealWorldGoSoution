section 2 Command-Line Tools

- Command-line flags and Arguments
- Reading and setting environment Variables
- Configration using TOML, YAML, and JSON
- Unix pipe and Signals
- ANSI coloring Application

--------------------

sec2 ch8 Using Command-Line Flags

- flag package - Simple to add command-line flag arguments

go run sec2/flages/*.go -h
go run sec2/flages/*.go -s Go -isawesome -howawesome 10 -c 1,2,3

--------------------

sec2 ch9 Using Command-Line Arguments

- Other uses for flag arguments
- Constructing a command
- Flagsets and positional arguments passed into the application

go run sec2/cmdargs/*.go -h
go run sec2/cmdargs/*.go version
go run sec2/cmdargs/*.go greet
go run sec2/cmdargs/*.go greet reader
go run sec2/cmdargs/*.go greet reader -goodbye

--------------------

sec2 ch10 Reading and Setting Environment Variables

-Basic getting and setting of environment variables

go get github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig
go get github.com/pkg/errors

--------------------

sec2 ch11 Configuration Using TOML, YAML, and JSON

- Configuration formats that Go has support for:
  - TOML
  - YAML
  - JSON

-Basic input and output using these formats

go get github.com/BurntSushi/toml@latest
go get gopkg.in/yaml.v2


--------------------

sec2 ch12 Working with Unix Pipes

- Taking an input on the left-hand side of a pipe
- Returning a list of words and their number of occurrences

echo "some string" | go run sec2/pipes/pipes.go
echo "test case test" | go run sec2/pipes/pipes.go

--------------------

sec2 ch13 Catching and Handling Signals

- Exploring the handling of signals - Use of a signal handling the Go routine

go run sec2/signals/signals.go
ps -ef | grep signals
kill -SIGTERM 9803

--------------------

sec2 ch14 An ANSI Coloring Application

- Basic coloring mechanism to color text red or plain

go get github.com/agtorre/gocolorize

--------------------

Summary

- Took in user input via coommand line
- Processing common data-types:
  - TOML
  - YAML
  - JSON

--------------------

section 3 Data Conversion and Composition

- Converting data types and interface casting
- Working with numeric data types using math and math/big
- Currency conversions and float64 considerations
- Using pointers and SQL NullTypes for encoding and Decoding
- Encoding and decoding Go data
- Struct tags and basic reflection in Go
- Implementing collections via closures

--------------------

sec3 ch15 Converting Data Types and Interface Casting

- Convenience functions:
  - Converting between numbers with casting
  - Converting between strings and other types
  - Converting between interfaces and types using reflection

--------------------

sec3 ch16 Working with Numeric Data Types using math and math/big

- Usage of the math package and math/big for fibonacci

- Focus on exposing more complex mathematical operations:
  - Pow
  - Sqrt
  - Cos

- math package operates on float64
- math/big package is for numbers that are too large to represent in a 64-bit
