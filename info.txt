--------------------

sec6 ch38 Making Use of OAuth2 Clients

- Performing some operations on an http.ResponseWriter

type HAndlerFunc func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)
type Handler interface {
  ServeHTTP(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)
}

curl "http://localhost:3333/name?name=Reader" -X GET
curl "http://localhost:3333/greeting" -X POST -d 'name=Reader&greeting=Goodbye'

--------------------

sec7 ch43 Using Structs and Closures for Stateful Handlers

- Using a struct controller to store a storage interface
- Creating two routes with a single handler - Modified by an other function

curl "http://localhost:3333/set" -X POST -d 'value=value'
curl "http://localhost:3333/get" -X GET
curl "http://localhost:3333/get/default" -X GET

--------------------

sec7 ch44 Validating Input for Go structs and User Inputs

curl "http://localhost:3333/" -X POST -d '{}'
curl "http://localhost:3333/" -X POST -d '{"name":"test"}'
curl "http://localhost:3333/" -X POST -d '{"name":"test","age":5}' -v

Validation
- Pass in a closure to our controller struct
- Advantage:
  - Mock and replace the validation functions at run time
  - Not bound to a single function signature
  - Pass in things such as a databases connection to our validation functions

Verror
  - Typed error - Verror
  - Holds validation error messages that can be displayed to users
  - Doesn't handle multiple validation messages at once
  - Modify the Verror type to allow for more state:
    - Including a map

--------------------

sec7 ch45 Rendering and Content Negotiation

- Using unrolled/render and a custom function to negotitate content type

go get github.com/unrolled/render

- Putting common RPC functions in a package
- Wrapping them in:
  - GRPC server
  - Standard web handler

protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:keyvalue/ keyvalue/keyvalue.proto

curl "http://localhost:3333/set" -d '{"key":"test","value":"123"}' -v
curl "http://localhost:3333/get?key=badtest"  -v 'name=Reader&greeting=Goodbye'
curl "http://localhost:3333/get?key=test"  -v 'name=Reader&greeting=Goodbye'
